                    <p>
                        Let me introduce myself real quick. My name is Jan, I'm 24 years old and I come from small village near Kranj. 
                        By education I am computer technician but currently I'm finishing Associate's degree at College for catering and tourism Bled. Yes I know, completely different
                        things but I wanted to gain experiences from foreign languages, business skills and communication strategies, that's why I went there. You know what they say, 
                        the more you know the more you are worth.</br> I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, SASS & JavaScript to make awesome websites and some Photoshop and SonyVegas to promote YouTube music from various generes such as 
                        Chillstep, Ambient & Lo-Fi music. In my free time I'm restoring rusty items. Basically hand work. You can learn more about my work if you click "Projects" in nav menu. Below you can see all of my previous work.

                    <h3>Solvera Lynx d.d</h3>
                    <h6>Software tester</h6>
                    <p>At first I was responsible for internal time tracking software and it's maintenance. 
                        My first task was to build new feature of the app to help other co workers see if they are on vacations on a specific date or not.
                        So if a developer for example wanted to talk about the new feature with the business owner on monday, he will see that he is not working that day
                        and he would prostpone the meeting.
                        Later on i started with GUI , software testing using TestComplete and Selenium testing tools.

                    <h3>Ripley's Aquarium</h3>
                    <h6>Photographer</h6>
                    <p>Working at Ripley's was quite fun. I was greeting guests everyday, took a pictures of them and then sell the pictures to the guests. I learned that working with people suits me well. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="job job-third">
                    <h3>Golden Corral</h3>
                    <h6>Cashier</h6>
                    <p>This was my first job ever where money or working with money was involved. At first It was hard to remember the picture of the cash but in time I was handeling the things pretty well and the guests& staff were quite happy with me.
                        I would reccomend everyone to taste the experience to work oversees or in foreign country just to see how beautiful Slovenia is and how good system we have.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="job job-fourth">
                    <h3>T2 d.o.o</h3>
                    <h6>Telephone sales</h6>
                    <p>We were selling the internet, TV and telephone packages to customers. I hated that because you cannot force someone to buy your product if he doesn't need it. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="job job-fifth">
                    <h3>Meiser's Gmbh</h3>
                    <h6>Server</h6>
                    <p>It was my first work in foreign country. It was really a good choice especially because of German language. I went there with zero experience in German language and then I learned it in 4 months. 
                        I mean not everyting ofcourse but the basics. I worked as a server and part time dishwasher.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job job-sixth">
                    <h3>McDonalds</h3>
                    <h6>Cook</h6>
                    <p>As a kid I never expected to work at McDonalds really, I've always wanted to eat there. I was working in almost every department such as cooking, sales and cleaning. It was quite fun and also gained valuable experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job job-seventh">
                        <h3>Interspar</h3>
                        <h6>Dishwasher</h6>
                        <p>I would mark that as my first job ever. Honestly i hated this because it's a dirty job and it was repeatable everyday in which I hate that. 
                            But you have to start somewhere to appreciate the future jobs.</p>
